This is an app with diverse functionality to practice React and Typescript. Also it serves as my final project for the DAW course at Fernando Wirtz Suarez.

It currently has:

-File upload / download support Drive style with SQL and REST api.
-Notes via React DnD and firestore.
-Tetris with leaderboard support via REST api and music, for those times just chilling at the office!.
-Calendar with mobile push-up notifications.
-Chat using React components, via REST api and firestore.
